# Assignment / Task 0

It is only through practice that you can learn any new programming language. As you all are new to Java, we have provided you many resources (On GCR) to learn from. For practicing, here is a list of programs you must try out to grab the concepts much more deeply.

We have used Java programs & tutorials available on Programiz website for this purpose. We have enlisted and linked all the programs below. It is not compulsory to do all, but we prefer to do so. After understanding, write all these programs on your own.

Although entire programs are available there, don't just copy - paste. Understand and then try to write on your own otherwise you are cheating with yourself.

Without proper Java understanding you can't learn Native Android.
